# Challenge #4 - Chemical symbols from words
This challenge consists in creating a function that will receive as argument a string of latin letters from which the output is created as chemical symbols. As a simple task it should return only one set of possible combinations, as a more complex task it should return multiple combinations (maybe all?) of chemical symbols.

Examples:

I will use my name
```js
'Nicu' // => ['N', 'I', 'C', 'U'] or ['Ni', 'Cu']
```

The best place in the world
```js
'Moldova' // => ['Mo', 'O', 'V'] not all characters can be used :(
```
